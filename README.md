👋 Hi, I'm Kuba!

I'm a multitasker extraordinaire, juggling between the realms of data science and photography. 💻📸

Currently, I work as a **Data Scientist at Samsung R&D Poland**, where I design and implement recommender systems to serve customers at scale.

🔭 I’m currently working on recommender systems.  
🌱 I’m currently learning cloud infrastructure development and management.  
👯 I’m eager to collaborate on projects that aim to make the world a better place.  
📫 You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakubkoloczek) or [email](mailto:koloczek.jakub@gmail.com)  

✈️ When I'm not immersed in pixels and algorithms, you'll find me indulging in sports and travel, often with a camera in hand.
🚀 Let's chat and see where this journey takes us!
